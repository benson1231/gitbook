# Statistics

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and organize characteristics of a dataset.

- **Mean**: Average of the data
- **Median**: Middle value when sorted
- **Mode**: Most frequent value
- **Standard Deviation (SD)**: Spread of data around the mean
- **Variance**: Squared standard deviation
- **Range**: Difference between max and min
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Range of the middle 50% of the data

## 2. Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.

- **Hypothesis Testing**: T-tests, ANOVA
- **Confidence Intervals**: Estimate of population parameters
- **P-value**: Probability of obtaining observed results if the null hypothesis is true
- **Effect Size**: Quantifies the magnitude of a difference (e.g., Cohen's d)

## 3. Probability Distributions

- **Normal Distribution**: Symmetrical, bell-shaped
- **Binomial Distribution**: Discrete distribution for binary outcomes
- **Poisson Distribution**: Counts of events in a fixed interval
- **Exponential Distribution**: Time between events in a Poisson process

## 4. Correlation and Regression

- **Correlation**: Measures linear relationship between variables (e.g., Pearson's r)
- **Simple Linear Regression**: One independent variable predicting one dependent variable
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Multiple predictors

## 5. Categorical Data Analysis

- **Chi-square Test**: Tests association between categorical variables
- **Contingency Table**: Frequency distribution for categorical variables
- **Odds Ratio / Relative Risk**: Measures of association

## 6. Statistical Assumptions

- **Normality**: Data should be normally distributed for parametric tests
- **Homoscedasticity**: Equal variances across groups
- **Independence**: Observations should be independent

## 7. Sampling Methods

- **Random Sampling**: Every member has an equal chance
- **Stratified Sampling**: Dividing population into subgroups
- **Cluster Sampling**: Randomly selecting entire groups

## 8. Common Statistical Tests

| Test               | Use Case                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| T-test             | Comparing two group means                 |
| ANOVA              | Comparing multiple group means            |
| Chi-square test    | Association between categorical variables |
| Mann-Whitney U     | Non-parametric test for two groups        |
| Kruskal-Wallis     | Non-parametric ANOVA                      |
